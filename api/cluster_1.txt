## 6.4 Comparison with Previous Studies

In Section 6, Conclusion, it is highlighted that experimental results indicate that JCR-ACF exhibits greater stability when faced with challenging facial variations compared to other methods. 

### Key Points:
- "ACFs contain discriminative local high-level features for classification, and local regular regions provide a complete and robust description of face images."
- The proposed JCR has effectively utilized the distinctiveness and commonality of different local regions by performing representations for each ACF, requiring different ACFs from various local regions to maintain similar representation coefficients.
- Extensive experiments show that JCR-ACF is more robust to complex and challenging facial variations compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- The testing stage solely involves matrix multiplication operations, which contributes to the efficiency of JCR-ACF.

## 6.5 Practical Application and Testing

The system has undergone some testing, but its transition from a research method to a practical application depends on multiple factors, including:
- **Feasibility** of implementation
- Required resources
- Technical demands

Further studies are required to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world applications.
