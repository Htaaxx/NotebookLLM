## Getting Started (Local Development, manually)
### Clone project
```
git clone https://github.com/Htaaxx/NoteUS/
```
### API detail
```
cd api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Runs at http://localhost:8000
### Front-end detail
Built using Next.js, the front-end provides a modern UI for interacting with the APIs and backend.
```
cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```
Runs at http://localhost:3000
### database detail
```
cd back-end
npm install
node src/server
```
Runs at http://localhost:5000
### Environment Variables
If needed, you can copy the sample environment files:
```
cp api/.env.example api/.env
cp back-end/.env.example back-end/.env.local
cp front-end/.env.example back-end/.env.local
```
## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development with Docker)
To run the entire application (API, frontend, and database), simply run:
```
docker-compose up
```
Docker Compose will automatically:
	1.	Start the API
	2.	Wait for the API to become ready
	3.	Start the frontend and database once the API is up
No additional setup is needed ‚Äî just make sure Docker is running on your machine.
