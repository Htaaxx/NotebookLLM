## Getting Started (Local Development, manually)
### Clone project
```
git clone https://github.com/Htaaxx/NoteUS/
```
### API detail
```
cd api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Runs at http://localhost:8000
### Front-end detail
Built using Next.js, the front-end provides a modern UI for interacting with the APIs and backend.
```
cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```
Runs at http://localhost:3000
### database detail
```
cd back-end
npm install
node src/server
```
Runs at http://localhost:5000
### Environment Variables
If needed, you can copy the sample environment files:
```
cp api/.env.example api/.env
cp back-end/.env.example back-end/.env.local
cp front-end/.env.example back-end/.env.local
```
## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development with Docker)
To run the entire application (API, frontend, and database), simply run:
```
docker-compose up
```
Docker Compose will automatically:
	1.	Start the API
	2.	Wait for the API to become ready
	3.	Start the frontend and database once the API is up
No additional setup is needed — just make sure Docker is running on your machine.
