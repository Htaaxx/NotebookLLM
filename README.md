## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

### API detail
```
cd api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Runs at http://localhost:8000
### Front-end detail
Built using Next.js, the front-end provides a modern UI for interacting with the APIs and backend.
```
cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```
Runs at http://localhost:3000
### Back-End detail
```
cd back-end
npm install
node src/server
```
Runs at http://localhost:5000
### Environment Variables
If needed, you can copy the sample environment files:
```
cp api/.env.example api/.env
cp back-end/.env.example back-end/.env.local
cp front-end/.env.example back-end/.env.local
```
### Docker Integration (Coming Soon)
We are working on integrating docker-compose to simplify project setup and deployment. Soon, you‚Äôll be able to start all services ‚Äî API, back-end, and front-end ‚Äî with a single command:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
This will automatically:
* Build and run the Python API
* 	Start the Express.js back-end server
* 	Launch the Next.js front-end in development mode
